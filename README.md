Hello people, today I'm in autonomy in my classroom.

Our professor tel me to make a program as I want. 

After a long reflection, I decided to create a program that will allow you to generate few files to create a great Webpage.
Â 
I hope you will love my program and if you have any questions or a suggestion tell me.

Enjoy and thanks for your collaboration.

For use this program, it's not very complicate.

You must install node, npm and four packages here bellow :

--> figlet
--> clear
--> chalk
--> inquirer
--> fs
--> slug

In first, in your console you must install node and after npm.

Here is how install node and npm : 

Node in Mac --> In console(brew install node) or in Internet (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Node in Windows --> In internet https://nodejs.org/en/download/

For install, you need open your console and be in the folder where is my program.
And in your console you'll must write : "npm install <package_name>"

For example : "npm install figlet" or "npm install inquirer"

When the packages are installed, let's go to test my program.

In your console write : "node index.js" that allow to launch my index programm.

Great, you are a real programmer.

Bye bye.
